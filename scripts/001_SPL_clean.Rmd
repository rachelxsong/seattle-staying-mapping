This script creates two new intermediary datasets:

1) SPL_1823.csv: the SPL staying dataset filtered for year 2018 and 2023 with new columns for location_neighborhood (the neighborhood of the observation location, based on the SPL location naming) and S_HOOD (the neighborhood of the observation location, based on the Seattle Neighborhood Map Atlas naming)

2) SPL_1823_location.geojson: the shapefiles and centroid lat/lon for all the location_ids in SPL 2018 and 2023
