PROGRESS REPORT
Group members: Annie Xu, Jovani Azpeitia, Rachel Song, Rebecca Schachtman

We created a repository on GitHub called “seattle-staying-mapping” with a few 
folders to stay organized. There is a data folder that contains all the data 
files we will be using, a script folder with the R script, and then a writing 
folder with our proposal and this progress report. Thus far, we have been 
working on using GitHub collaboratively, which has consumed most of our time. 
We have also made some progress on our data. Specifically, we spent some time 
exploring the data structure and learning what each column in the file 
Public_Life_Data_-_People_Staying_20240416.csv meant. We determined that we 
were first interested in visually comparing the proportion of women to men 
observed staying by neighborhood and between 2018 and 2023. We created a new 
column in the data to represent these ratios called FM_ratio. Next, we renamed 
the neighborhood names in this data set to match the names in 
Seattle_street_map.geojson file, which is the file that contains the geometry 
information needed to create the map. After, we merged these two datasets by 
neighborhood names, and then created a preliminary visualization, where the 
fill color is the FM_ratio. Finally, we cleaned up out GitHub repository and 
decided to add a folder called archive so we can temporarily store unneeded 
files there instead of deleting them immediately.
