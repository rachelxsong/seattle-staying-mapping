Our project aims to examine the Seattle Public Life Study, a systematic 
observation of how people use public space throughout the city. We will use 
three datasets, one collected in 2018 and one in 2023 that describe people’s 
patterns of staying in certain Seattle neighborhoods, and one mapping 
geospatial data of Seattle neighborhoods. In these data, “people staying” is 
defined by variables such as: staying time, sitting positions, and behaviors 
while staying (e.g., talking to others, using electronics, smoking, eating, 
etc.). More specifically, we are interested in examining the number of people 
staying in each Seattle neighborhood by demographic variables such as age, 
gender, and/or race, and how this has changed between 2018 and 2023. 

We aim to 1) create two visualizations in which the data are mapped onto each 
Seattle neighborhood (one for 2018 and one for 2023), and 2) run accompanying 
statistical analyses quantifying change. In this project, we will practice 
skills learned in class including version control and collaboration via GitHub, 
data visualization, working with big data, and working with geospatial data (we 
are not sure if this is in the scope of the class!).
