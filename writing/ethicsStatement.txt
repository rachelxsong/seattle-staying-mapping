The main ethical issue with using the Seattle Public Life data is that “participants” in these 
large datasets did not consent to being part of the study. The metadata document states that the 
study “completed a Privacy Assessment through the City of Seattle IT Department” (page 3 of 
metadata document). While this takes a legal route to ensuring participants’ privacy is not 
disrupted, participants were never informed nor could consent to being recorded at the various 
public locations in Seattle. As users of this public dataset, there is not much we can do to 
change the beneficence or justice requirements laid out in Paxton (2020). However, we only 
analyze the dataset by one demographic at a time, to reduce the chances of identifying specific 
participants. 
 As researchers, we have sought to represent participants’ unique experiences based on several 
demographic variables: gender, race, and age. In earlier iterations of our graphs, we had simply 
collapsed demographic variables into a single marker that only considered the largest subgroups 
of participants (i.e., female-to-male ratio, underrepresented minority-to-White ratio). We 
realized that this erased the experiences of non-binary people (for the gender variable) and 
lumped all people of color into one group (for the race variable). Our group decided that 
although it would significantly increase the number of visualizations our team produced, we 
would create visualizations for the percentage of each subgroup throughout Seattle. This meant 
creating maps for each level of the gender, race, and age variables - totaling 14 visualizations 
instead of 3.
